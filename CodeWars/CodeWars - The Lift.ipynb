    "- Still room for a lot of improvements. Especially I don't like passing the historic stops to the _run_elevator_ functions everytime, but it's currently needed for it to have access to the last floor stopped on during last run up/down. The alternative would be to add the historic stops as an object variable, but since it should be reset everytime the elevator runs that doesn't feel very clean either.\n",
    "- There are still nested conditionals that could be broken out into smaller functions, but unless there's a reason to do it, I think that would be starting to verge on making the code too atomic."
