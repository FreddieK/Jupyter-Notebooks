    "- **Generator Expressions** - The lazy evaluation of generator expressions is oftentimes convenient, but seems to also cause some overhead at runtime at least in some cases which indicates it should be a deliberate decision when to use and not. On the upside for generator expressions; [they consume less memory](https://swizec.com/blog/python-and-lazy-evaluation/swizec/5148).\n",
    "- **Trust but verify** - On the surface trivial changes in code can turn out to have significant impact on performance. Thus, having benchmark tests ready is of great help when refactoring to avoid potentially negative surprises."
